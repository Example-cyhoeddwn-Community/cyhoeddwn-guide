# Display deployment

## Introduction

cyhoeddwn is designed to be as "display agnostic" as possible, that is to say that the hardware you chose to use will have very few minimum requirements. You just need to make sure that:

- The hardware is capable of running a modern web browser (compatible with HTML5 and vanilla JS, if you can open this webpage on it, you should be set)
- The display should have a display which can display landscape content without scaling being detrimental to the displayed content
- The hardware is capable of being left unattended for a long period of time
- The hardware should be connected to a reliable internet connection

This should give a wide variety of options for display deployment. Where possible you should make use of existing hardware, in order to keep the cost of displays as low as possible.

Here are a few examples of suitable displays:

- An old laptop/computer connected to a television
- A Raspberry Pi microcomputer connected to a monitor
- A SFF PC (i.e. an Intel NUC, Compute Stick or similar) connected to a display
- A Chromecast connected to a display and another device which is casting to it
- An old tablet

## Uniformity or diversity?
