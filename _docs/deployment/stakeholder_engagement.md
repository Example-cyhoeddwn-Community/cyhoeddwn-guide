Although at first glance this may seem to be a trivial matter, adequately engaging with other stakeholders in the community is the most important step for ensuring the sustainability of your deployment of cyhoeddwn. Democratic decision-making is at the heart of cyhoeddwn, this is something that is aided by technology, but for which technology cannot replace.

## Power is vested in the community
Your deployment of cyhoeddwn belongs to the community, not one individual. Where existing structures are extant in your community, you should attempt to integrate the management of cyhoeddwn in these structures, for example as a committee of a parish or village council. You should have regular meetings to discuss concerns about the system and plans for mitigation well in advance of the first screen going up.

Your committee (as a suggestion) should include members responsible for:
- Financing
- Administration, moderation, and user affairs
- Installation and maintenance of displays
- Backend management (sysops)

## Your first meeting
In your first meeting, you will establish if the community has a genuine need for cyhoeddwn, and if it does, who will be responsible for it. The following agenda is proposed:
- Is there genuine interest in the community for the installation of cyhoeddwn?
- What roles should committee members have, and how should committee members be elected, how long should they serve for, how can they be removed from the committee, and what might cause a committee member to be forced to step down?

You should not hold another meeting until you have a group that the community deems to be representative of itself.

## Your second meeting
In your second meeting, you will establish how the project will be funded. The following agenda is proposed:
- What is the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of the project likely to be?
- What are the expected ongoing costs?
- How will the project be funded, and what will be done if funding is not sufficient (contingency plans)?
  - Is funding available from a local authority or charitable fund?
  - Will the project be funded from donations?
  - What fundraising activities could be done to finance the project?
  - Will node hosts pay for their own displays, or will funding be provided by centralised means?
  - Should node hosts be remunerated for electricity costs?
  - Where will funds for the project be stored?
  - Who will take ownership of assets if the project is wound up?
  - Et cetera.

## Your third meeting
In your third meeting, you will ask for reports from delegates, which should be deliberated upon in the meeting. You should leave sufficient time between the second and third meetings to facilitate the time taken for these reports to be made. You should request:
- Decisions on which persons should be made administrators, how long they are to remain as administrators, and how the next administrators should be selected. Amendments that are made to the exemplar community guidelines for adoption.
- Who is responsible for installing new displays and how displays should be ordered. What maintenance schedule is necessary and how users/node owners should be able to make requests for maintenance.
