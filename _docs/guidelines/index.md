## Mission statement

cyhoeddwn is a platform for communities to share content. Those sharing content do so in order to provide others with the possibility of doing something interesting and exciting, as a means of providing opportunities for work or education, to find like-minded individuals, and in general, to bring a community closer. Those seeking such opportunities are able to view these opportunities either through situated displays in the community, or through the cyhoeddwn web app.
