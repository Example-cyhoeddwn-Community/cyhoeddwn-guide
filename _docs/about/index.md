# cyhoeddwn explained

## What is cyhoeddwn?
cyhoeddwn (kəhɔɨðʊn) is a web application used to manage content that can be displayed on connected nodes. A node is any device which can display content from the web in any modern web browser. cyhoeddwn is designed to be used in rural settings, but in practice could be used wherever required.

## What content can I display on cyhoeddwn?
As long as it's static (for example: text or images) and it fits within the community guidelines, practically anything!

## Why does cyhoeddwn exist?
cyhoeddwn is kept in active development by [Genevieve Clifford](https://dev.becquerel.me). cyhoeddwn was created to fulfil part of the requirements of completing an MSc in Computer Science at Swansea University.
